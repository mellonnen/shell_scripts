# Shell Scripts
A collection of shell-scripts I use.

Some scripts are ripped from other sources. (I will try to include sources, but some I have lost ðŸ˜¥)

## My Favorites
- `cd_with_fzf` which allows me to jump to any folder on my system instantaneously âš¡.  
    This script is taken from [nixcasts](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgREucssIfY9e0Iy3yhse8w)(A great YouTube channel higly recomend to sub!).
    Personally I have this command mapped to a keybinding in my shell, enabling me to jump to any folder using the [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) fuzzy-finder just using a couple of keystrokes.

- `brews`, `aps` allows me to search the `brew` and `apt-get` package-manager using `fzf` ðŸ”Ž.  
    Once again inspired by `nixcasts`.
- `download` moves the most recently created item in my downloads folder to my current folder ðŸ“¥.  
    As I am on `WSL`(Windows Subsystem for Linux) and the downloads folder is usually very far away, this script is very helpful.
- `create` allows me to create a new Github project from anywhere on my system. 
- `mcd` very simple script that creates a directory than moves into said created directory, a very common pattern when working on the shell.
